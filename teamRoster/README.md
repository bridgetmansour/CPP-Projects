# Soccer Team Roster using Vectors and Functions

This program will store roster and rating information for a soccer team in which coaches rate players during tryouts to ensure a balanced team by:
1. Prompting the user to input five pairs of numbers: A player's jersey number (0 - 99) and the player's rating (1 - 9) and storing the jersey numbers in one int vector and the ratings in another int vector. Outputing these vectors (i.e., output the roster).
2. Implementing a menu of options for a user to modify the roster where option is represented by a single character. The program initially outputs the menu, and outputs the menu after a user chooses an option. The program ends when the user chooses the option to Quit. For this step, the other options do nothing.
3. Implementing the "Output roster" menu option, making sure to write a separate function for each menu option.
4. Implementing the "Add player" menu option, prompting the user for a new player's jersey number and rating, and appending the values to the two vectors.
5. Implementing the "Delete player" menu option, prompting the user for a player's jersey number, and removing the player from the roster by deleting the jersey number and rating.
6. Implementing the "Update player rating" menu option, prompting the user for a player's jersey number, prompting again for a new rating for the player, and then changing that player's rating.
7. Implementing the "Output players above a rating" menu option, prompting the user for a rating, and printing the jersey number and rating for all players with ratings above the entered value.
