# Pig Dice Game
This program implements the pig dice game. 

Pig is a dice game where each player during their turn rolls a 6-sided die. If the player rolls a 2 through 6, they decide whether they want to keep their turn score or roll again. If they roll a 1, they lose all of the points for that turn and their turn is over.

The first player to reach 100 points or more wins.
